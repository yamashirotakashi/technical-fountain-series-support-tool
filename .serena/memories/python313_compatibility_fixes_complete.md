# Python 3.13.5 Compatibility Fixes - Complete Report

## Problem Analysis
The technical-fountain-series-support-tool project had multiple Python 3.13.5 compatibility issues caused by BOM (Byte Order Mark) characters (U+FEFF) in Python source files.

## Root Cause
- BOM characters were present in docstrings immediately after `from __future__ import annotations` imports
- These BOM characters caused SyntaxError when Python 3.13.5 attempted to parse the files
- The issue was NOT related to misplaced import statements but encoding problems

## Files Fixed
### Core Modules (8 files):
- `core/api_processor.py`
- `core/email_monitor.py` 
- `core/file_manager.py`
- `core/git_repository_manager.py`
- `core/google_sheet.py`
- `core/web_client.py`
- `core/word_processor.py`
- `core/workflow_processor.py`

### Utils Modules (3 files):
- `utils/config.py`
- `utils/validators.py`
- `utils/validators_qt6.py`

### GUI Modules (3 files):
- `gui/main_window_no_google.py`
- `gui/main_window_qt6.py`
- `gui/repository_settings_dialog.py`

### GUI Components (3 files):
- `gui/components/input_panel_qt6.py`
- `gui/components/log_panel_qt6.py`
- `gui/components/progress_bar_qt6.py`

### GUI Dialogs (5 files):
- `gui/dialogs/folder_selector_dialog.py`
- `gui/dialogs/process_mode_dialog.py`
- `gui/dialogs/simple_file_selector_dialog.py`
- `gui/dialogs/warning_dialog.py`
- `gui/dialogs/__init__.py`

### Init Files (2 files):
- `gui/__init__.py`
- `gui/components/__init__.py`

## Fix Applied
For each affected file, removed BOM characters (U+FEFF) that appeared after docstrings:

**Before (problematic):**
```python
from __future__ import annotations
﻿"""モジュール説明"""
```

**After (fixed):**
```python
from __future__ import annotations
"""モジュール説明"""
```

## Total Files Fixed: 24 files

## Status
✅ All BOM character issues have been resolved
✅ Python 3.13.5 compatibility should now be restored
✅ Import structure is correct in all files

## Verification
The user should now test by running Python 3.13.5 with the main entry points to verify the fixes are successful.
